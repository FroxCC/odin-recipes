    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      It is complicated to say about broasted chicken within a sentence.
      Actually, it is a type of fried chicken. But the main difference from any
      other fried chicken is that in this cooking method chicken is cooked in a
      closed frying pan like a pressure cooker called Broasting machine. By this
      cooking process chicken pieces first marinated in the refrigerator then
      coated with spices and all-purpose flour and then fried in a Broasting
      pot. As the Broaster pot work like a pressure cooker that is why some
      times it is also called pressure cooker fryer or pressure fryer. This
      recipe was invented by the company Broaster and it is the trademark of
      Broaster company.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Chicken 1 kg (cut it into eight pieces)</li>
      <li>All-purpose flour 2 cups</li>
      <li>Turmeric powder ½ tsp</li>
      <li>Red chili powder ½ tsp</li>
      <li>food color ¼ tsp</li>
      <li>One egg white</li>
      <li>Ginger garlic powder 2 tsp</li>
      <li>Black pepper powder 1 tsp</li>
      <li>Buttermilk 1 liter</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            At first, cut a whole chicken into eight pieces then wash all the
            pieces very well by freshwater. Drain off all water from the chicken
            pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now take 1-liter buttermilk in a container and sink all the chicken
            pieces into it. Close the jar and keep it in a refrigerator for 8 to
            12 hours for marination. Remember, marinating time not exceed 24
            hours.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>
            After complete marination process, remove the chicken pieces from
            the refrigerator and drain off the buttermilk. Make sure all excess
            buttermilk drained off perfectly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Now take all the spices (Turmeric powder, red chili powder, food
            color, ginger-garlic powder, salt, black pepper, and ground all
            spices) in a bowl and mix them well. Add this mixture on all sides
            of the chicken pieces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take another two bowls and add all-purpose flour in one bowl and egg
            white in another. Dip all the chicken pieces in egg white one by one
            then coated with all-purpose flour. All sides are coated perfectly
            by all-purpose flour.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Now take all the pieces in a tray and covered with a plastic paper. Keep
        the chicken tray in a refrigerator for a minimum of 1 hour but do not
        exceed 12 hours. Exceeding 12 hours could result in a dark coating when
        cooked. After this process, remove the chicken pieces from the
        refrigerator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Take a Broaster (pressure fryer) and heat cooking oil in it at 360F
        degree temperature. If Broaster is not available, then use a pressure
        cooker for frying.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dip all the chicken pieces one by one in hot cooking oil and then close
        the pressure cooker. Cook it with medium flame up to 7-8 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        After 8 minutes open the pressure cooker and take one chicken piece out.
        Check it perfectly cooked or not. If it cooked perfectly then remove all
        the pieces from the cooker or Broaster.
      </li>
      <li>
        Keep them on kitchen paper to absorb extra oil. After five minutes, you
        can serve your favorite broasted chicken.
      </li>
