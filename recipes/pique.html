    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Start by peeling the potatoes. After cutting them, it is good to put
        them in water so that they do not rust. Dry them well before frying
        them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat a good amount of oil in a frying pan, if you have a thermometer it
        should reach 160C.
      </li>
      <li>
        Potatoes are cooked or fried 2 times. The first is to cook the potatoes
        and the second to give them the crispness that characterizes them.
      </li>
      <li>
        After the first frying, start cooking the chorizo â€‹â€‹and sausages in a
        pan with a little oil. Once cooked, reserve on a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use the same pan to seal and cook the meat. Don't forget to season with
        salt and pepper.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once everything is cooked, mix the chorizo, the sausages, the meat; add
        the fries and mix.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place this mixture in a large serving dish, and finish the dish by
        adding the onions, tomatoes, eggs, and chili.
      </li>
    </ol>
