    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Easy homemade chicken ramen, with a flavorful broth, roasted chicken,
      fresh veggies, lots of noodles, and a soft cooked egg. Inspired by
      traditional Japanese ramen, but on the table in under an hour.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 chicken breasts (boneless, skin-on)*</li>
      <li>kosher salt and freshly-ground black pepper, to season</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>2 tsp sesame or vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 tsp fresh ginger, minced</li>
      <li>1 Tbsp fresh garlic, minced</li>
      <li>3 Tbsp low-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp mirin</li>
      <li>4 cups rich chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 oz dried shitake mushrooms (or 1/2 cup fresh)</li>
      <li>1-2 tsp sea salt, to taste</li>
      <li>2 large eggs</li>
      <li>1/2 cup scallions, sliced</li>
      <li>2 (3 oz) packs dried ramen noodles</li>
      <li>optional: fresh jalapeño or chili slices, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>COOK THE CHICKEN:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 375℉. Season the chicken generously with salt and
          pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the
          chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and
          releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over
          and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.
        </li>
        <li>
          Melt the butter in a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the
          chicken, skin-side down, and cook until the skin is golden brown and
          releases easily from the pan, about 5-7 minutes. Flip the chicken over
          and cook for another 4-5 minutes, until golden.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>MAKE THE RAMEN BROTH:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Heat the oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. Add the
          garlic and ginger, and cook for a few minutes until softened. Add the
          soy sauce and mirin, and stir to combine. Cook for another minute.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the stock, cover, and bring to a boil. Remove the lid, and let
          simmer uncovered for 5 minutes, then add the dried mushrooms. Simmer
          gently for another 10 minutes, and season with salt, to taste.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>MAKE THE SOFT-BOILED EGGS:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fill a pot with enough water to cover the eggs, and bring to a boil.
          Gently lower the eggs (still cold from the fridge) into the boiling
          water, and let simmer for 7 minutes (for a slightly-runny yolk) or 8
          minutes (for a soft, but set-up yolk).
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, fill a large bowl with ice water. When the timer finishes,
          transfer the eggs to the ice bath to stop the cooking process. Wait at
          least 5 minutes, or until cool enough to handle, then carefully peel
          away the shell and slice in half, lengthwise. Set aside until ready to
          serve.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <li>ASSEMBLE THE RAMEN BOWLS:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, chop the scallions and jalapeño (if using). Slice the
          chicken into thin pieces. Set aside. When the eggs finish cooking, add
          the ramen noodles to the boiling water.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cook for 2-3 minutes, until soft, then divide the noodles into two
          large bowls. Add the sliced chicken and the ramen broth. Top with the
          fresh scallions, jalapeño, and the soft boiled egg. Serve immediately.
          Enjoy!!
